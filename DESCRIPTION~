Description: For each pair of FCS files, normalize data for shared markers using quantile-normalization. Then train machine leraning models to predict distinct markers from shared markers. Finally, uses UMAP on either shared or shared + predicted markers to visualize the expression of predicted markers. Reports prediction quality metrics. Exports FCS files with predicted data in native flow cytometry units.
